# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Which model to use for cortical spiking neurons?**   
Izhikevich, EM _Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on_ 2004:15(5):1063-1070
[15484883](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15484883) ,  
**Abstract:**   
We discuss the biological plausibility and computational efficiency of some of
the most useful models of spiking and bursting neurons. We compare their
applicability to large-scale simulations of cortical neural networks.  

The model is according to the paper _Which Model to Use for Cortical Spiking
Neurons?_ Figure1(L) integrator has been reproduced by MathSBML. The ODE and
the parameters values are taken from the a paper _Simple Model of Spiking
Neurons_ The original format of the models are encoded in the MATLAB format
existed in the ModelDB with Accession number 39948

Figure1 are the simulation results of the same model with different choices of
parameters and different stimulus function or events. a=0.02; b=-0.1; c=-55;
d=6; V=-60; u=b*V;
